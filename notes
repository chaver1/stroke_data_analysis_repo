Notes on Data Structure:
Initial Dimensions: 5110 x 12 dimensions
Columns: {
num: id, age, hypertension, heart_disease, avg_glucose level, stroke
chr: gender, ever_married, work_type, residency_type, bmi, smoking_status
} *those with (NA) or (NULL) contain those values in those columns
*bmi is mostly numerical data, so while the other chr data can be factorized,
bmi should first be converted to numerical data and then the rows with missing
values should be removed.

Useful Variable Groupings:
-demographics: age, gender, ever_married, work_type, residency_type
-clinical data: hypertensions, heart_disease, avg_glucose_level, stroke,
bmi, smoking_status
